# Web-Development
Hi ðŸ‘‹

recently I came across a very exciting oppurtunity to create a web page for a few potential clients, but as an engineer with a data science background I only knew python and
the flask package ...

Until I made this repository!!
I dove straight into the world of HTML and CSS and even gained exposure to Javascript. So here it is my first web development and frontend project to showcase that our skills as humans can cross any limits.
All encouragment and inspiration from God who really pushed me to get out of my technical comfort zone. More details on the project to come!
